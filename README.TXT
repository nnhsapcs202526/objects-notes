Git - The software/tool that tracks changes in your code.

GitHub - An online website that can store your git repositories in the cloud.  It's like
            having a backup of your code that you can access anywhere.
            
Repository (repo) - A folder of code that git is tracking.  It contains all of your project files (unit files) and
        the entire history of changes.
        
Clone - Makes a copy of a GitHub repository onto your local computer.

Commit - a permanent snapshot of your project at a point in time. Each commit has a message describing the changes.
        Analogy: like a save point in a video game.
        
Commit message - a short description you write to describe the changes you last made.  Useful to yourself and others (me).

Push - Upload your commits to GitHub so you can access them anywhere.
