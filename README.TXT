Git - The software / tool that tracks changes in our code.  Saves our work and allows us to work on multiple computers.

GitHub - An online website that can store your Git repositories (in the cloud). For us, it's like having a backup of our work.

Repository (repo) - A folder that Git is tracking.  It contains all of your project files and the entire history of your project.

Clone - Makes a full copy of a GitHub repository onto your local computer.

Commit - A permanent snapshot of your project at a point in time.  Each commit has a message describing the changes.
        Analogy: Like a save point in a video game.
        
Commit message - A short description you write to yourself (or others) when you make a commit.

Push - Upload your local commit(s) to GitHub so they are saved in the cloud.

***making a change to the repository from Github.com to simulate a change from another computer***

Pull - Downloads the latest version of your repo from GitHub to your computer (i.e., any changes you've made elsewhere, like home)
